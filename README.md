# TinyMCE CodeSample Prism Plugin w/ all languages

Simple, this is a modified of `tinyMCE/codesample` plugin to add all Prism supported languages. So instead of having only 10 languages, now having **nearly ~120 languages** with Prism supported styles.

I need to to have more languages in my projects and I created this modification since there is no way to make it an add-on for codesample plugin currently.

## Usage

Download everything in `codesample` directory and put into `tinymce/plugins/codesample` directory in your projects to override.

That's all!

## What languages are supported?

All listed on [Prism](http://prismjs.com/index.html#languages-list) page.

## Changing Prism themes?

Go to Prism, download the theme and override the `codesample/css/prism.css` file.
